Project Description:

In this project, my colleagues and I generated a hypothetical scenario: being located in Albuquerque, Austin, Dallas, and Boston, we needed a central place to meet once per year.  We settled on Denver, and the task we set ourselves was to find the optimal time of year to meet, minimizing both cost and delays.
